# Conclusions

30 Days of Python has been an immersive introduction to Python. I have gained so many skills and the most important is that I learnt how to show up to code daily. Learning to code requires practice and it is important to build a good practice habit in order to excel. Practicing daily is a skill I have gained in addition to learning the core concepts of the Python programming language in preparation for my foray into Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence.

I will extend my appreciation to the mentors of Arewa Data Science Academy for guiding us throughout the duration of the Python phase of the fellowship. Special appreciation to Mr Asabeneh S. Yetayeh for creating this amazing learning content. I appreciate you all.

I can confidently say that I am not the same person I was when I started this.
